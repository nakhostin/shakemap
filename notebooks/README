These notebooks were developed when we were testing out the code.
They make use of the ShakeMap code from within python and would
only be useful for developers. Please see the ShakeMap manual and
the wiki on github associated with this repository for guidance on
intsallilng and running ShakeMap.

We hope to expand these notebooks to include more interesting
examples of to make use of the shakemap code as a python library
in the future.
